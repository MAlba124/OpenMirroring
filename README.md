# OpenMirroring

OpenMirroring is a suite of programs that allows for easy mirroring of displays and windows from one device to another.
The suite consists of two programs, a sender and a receiver, that both implement the [FCast](https://fcast.org/) protocol.

### Platform support

The current platform support matrix looks like this:

|            |Linux (Wayland)  |Linux (X11)  |Windows  |MacOS     |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|----------|
|OMSender    |Yes              |Yes          |Yes      |No        |
|OMReceiver  |Yes              |Yes          |Yes      |Untested  |

OMSender can also pair with other FCast receivers by selecting the HLS option under `Select protocol` when selecting source.
